    <h2>disclaimer</h2>

    <p>This page is meant to serve as a general dump of things I have done over the years. It is updated when I have the time and will to do it - which is to say - not often. I have added this sentence as otherwise the disclaimer would be quite short and wouldn't serve as a thick spacer between the header and the content section of this page. That will tell you everything you need to know about me.</p>

    <h3>2025</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/parametric-equalizer">&#128274;parametric-equalizer</a>] Parametric equalizer guitar effect pedal. The circuit is based on 3 RLC filter sections with the variable inductor implemented using a TL07x operational amplifier. This is my first project using surface mounted components. I have learned how to use an OpAmp to implement a buffer and an amplifier; how an RLC filter works; how to use an OpAmp and an RLC filter to shape the frequency response of a circuit; how equalizers work. [<a class="image" href="./static-data/parametric-equalizer/prototype.jpeg">prototype</a>] [<a class="image" href="./static-data/parametric-equalizer/schematic.png">schematic</a>] [<a class="image" href="./static-data/parametric-equalizer/pcb.png">pcb</a>]</li>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crags/birchen_edge-94/reef_knot-11260">Reef Knot S 4b</a>] I have led my first Severe route. It is just a glorified high-ball boulder problem with minimum protection. Still counts.</li>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/waveform-generator">&#128274;waveform-generator</a>] Sin-wave generator for guitar input simulation using the DaisyDSP platform. I have used the <a href="https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed">DaisySeed</a> hardware, a potentiometer for frequency control, and a small I2C OLED display for current frequency value. Using ST-Link v3 Mini as a programmer. Written in C++. [<a class="image" href="./static-data/waveform-generator/prototype.jpeg">prototype</a>] [<a class="image" href="./static-data/waveform-generator/output.mov">output</a>]</li>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/meater">&#128274;meater</a>] Reverse engineer of the <a href="https://meater.com/">Meater</a> food temperature monitor. The original device requires a phone app and an account in their system. I have used the <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-esp32/">Arduino Nano ESP32</a> hardware, and a small I2C OLED display to display the current temperature. Written in Micropython.</li>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/relay-switch">&#128274;relay-switch</a>] A true bypass switch for guitar effect pedals using an <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/attiny13">ATTiny13</a> microcontroller and a latching DPDT signal relay. Meant to be used as a submodule in other guitar effect projects. Written in Arduino C++.</li>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/fuzz-factory">&#128274;fuzz-factory</a>] A clone of the <a href="https://www.zvex.com/guitar-pedals/fuzz-factory-guitar-effects-pedal">ZVEX Effects Fuzz Factory</a>. The original format was quite annoying, given it's horizontal orientation and input jacks on the sides. My aim was to make it fit the one true enclosure size and configuration.

      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/germanium-fuzz">&#128274;germanium-fuzz</a>] My take on the original <a href="https://electrosmash.com/germanium-fuzz">Germanium Fuzz Face</a>. Built with AC128 transistors I found on Ebay. The reverse polarity is implemented across +9V to GND instead of GND to -9V. I have standardised the switching mechanism, enclosure size, and potentiometer positions.

    <h3>2024</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/fuzz-face">&#128274;fuzz-face</a>] Silicon NPN transistor fuzz face guitar effect pedal. This is a very simple circuit that became my first adventure into analog audio effects. I have (re-)learned basics of the electronic circuits, basics of analog audio processing, how to use KiCAD to design a PCB, how to horribly mess up said PCB, how to place a manufacturing order, how to be patient while waiting on the order, how to solder, how to debug your mistakes, how to use oscilloscope, how to design 3d models for printing enclosures, how to design 3d models for printing jigs to drill into the aluminum enclosures. All of my "best practices" come from continuous improvement of this circuit whenever I have learned a new thing. Thank you <a href="https://jhspedals.info/">JHS Pedals</a> for showing me a new hobby and <a href="https://www.walrusaudio.com/">Walrus Audio</a> for inspiration.

    <h3>2016</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/polarbtdump">polarbtdump</a>] Command line tool to dump training data from <a href="https://www.polar.com/">Polar</a> M400 watch over Bluetooth, written in Swift 3. I got it to the stage where I could dump the contents of the watch filesystem into my local machine. I didn't have enough motivation to write the data transformation part. Later on I discovered climbing and have abandoned running as a sport. 
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/polarspoofer">polarspoofer</a>] Command line tool to eavesdrop on the Bluetooth communication between <a href="https://www.polar.com/">Polar</a> M400 watch and an iPhone device, written in Swift 2. It was meant to be a dirty and fast proxy.
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/polarusbdump">polarusbdump</a>] Command line tool to dump training data from <a href="https://www.polar.com/">Polar</a> M400 watch over USB, written in Java. It never got past a proof-of-concept stage as I focused on reverse engineering the Bluetooth communication.
      <li>I have moved to London, United Kingdom.</li>
