    <h2>disclaimer</h2>

    <p>This page is meant to serve as a general dump of things I've done over the years. It is updated when I have the time and will to do it - which is to say - not often. I have added this sentence as otherwise the disclaimer would be quite short and wouldn't serve as a thick spacer between the header and the content section of this page. That will tell you everything you need to know about me.</p>

    <h3>2025</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/parametric-equalizer">&#128274;parametric-equalizer</a>] I am currently working on a parametric equalizer guitar effect pedal. The effect is based on 3 RLC filter sections with the variable inductor implemented using a TL07x operational amplifier. This is my first project using SMD components and not through-hole.</li>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crags/birchen_edge-94/reef_knot-11260">Reef Knot S 4b</a>] I have led my first Severe route. It is just a glorified high-ball boulder problem with minimum protection. Still counts.</li>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/waveform-generator">&#128274;waveform-generator</a>] A really quick and dirty project for the DaisyDSP platform that allows me to generate a walking sin-wave to simulate guitar input. It utilises a <a href="https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed">DaisySeed</a> hardware, a potentiometer for frequency control, and a small I2C OLED display for current frequency value. Written in C++. Using ST-Link v3 Mini as a programmer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2016</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/polarbtdump">polarbtdump</a>] Command line tool to dump training data from <a href="https://www.polar.com/">Polar</a> M400 watch over Bluetooth, written in Swift 3. I got it to the stage where I could dump the contents of the watch filesystem into my local machine. I didn't have enough motivation to write the data transformation part. Later on I discovered climbing and have abandoned running as a sport. 
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/polarspoofer">polarspoofer</a>] Command line tool to eavesdrop on the Bluetooth communication between <a href="https://www.polar.com/">Polar</a> M400 watch and an iPhone device, written in Swift 2. It was meant to be a dirty and fast proxy.
      <li>[<a class="project" href="https://github.com/dredzik/polarusbdump">polarusbdump</a>] Command line tool to dump training data from <a href="https://www.polar.com/">Polar</a> M400 watch over USB, written in Java. It never got past a proof-of-concept stage as I focused on reverse engineering the Bluetooth communication.
      <li>I have moved to London, United Kingdom.</li>
